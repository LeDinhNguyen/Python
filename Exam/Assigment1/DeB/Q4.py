Problem 4:
A temporary prime number is a positive integer whose
all divisors (except 1 and its value) are prime number.
A prime number is also the temporary prime number
The first temporary prime number is 2.

Write a function to print all temporary prime
number that is smaller than or equal to n.

For example,
6 is a temporary prime number cuz
its divisors are 2, 3 (prime number)

Inp: 10
Out: 2 3 4 5 6 7 9 10

    :param n: int
    :return:
        1 - if n is temporary prime number
        0 - if n is not temporary prime number

def printAllTemporaryNumber(n: int):
    '''

    :param n: int
    :return: no return
    :task: print all temporary number in [2, n]
